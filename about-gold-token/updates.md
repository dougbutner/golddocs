##  Rewards Update 

After opening rewards on [bludac.io](https://bludac.io) we have removed "Silver Moons" from rewards, as well as the old once-per-month GOLD holders reward. Both of these tokens are now rewarded daily on [bludac.io](https://bludac.io). Because the old rewards were based on the LP token [GOLDSIL](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=SILVER-silversilver&input=GOLD-goldgoldgold) and the [GOLD](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/gold-goldgoldgold_wax-eosio.token) token, and so were the new rewards, this created competition and difficulty to collect the maximum reward. Bludac requires a 3-day wait to withdraw. The new rewards are both larger in terms of SILVER return and daily instead on monthly.   

We have also added a NFT reward for the top 100 GOLD holders for us collectively reaching a 🌕 Golden Moon starting at 🌕 15. Further details about this NFT including possible utility have not been released.

##  NGO Update 🌍

The legal process wasn't possible for us to secure our NGO in Peru as planned without a physical address, but we are continuing in the direction of permacultural curation organization. We really don't need an NGO to make this happen now (to raise charity funds + donate), but will move forward to a Peruvian NGO once we have land to plant ourselves. There's also an eventuality where we don't buy land in Peru, and in that case 100% of funds that end up in [gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund) will go to other permaculture projects in coordination with a public announcement.


## One Year! 🎂 🥳

GOLD has made it to one year old! In this time, we both remained the smallest market cap DeFi project, and also the largest % growth of market cap of any DeFi project. 

We're very pleased with the stability in the market, as well as the spreading of GOLD to more
