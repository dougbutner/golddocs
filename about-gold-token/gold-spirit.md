# The Spirit of GOLD 🕊️🌍

GOLD was created as a means to catalyze re-incorporation of the human collective into the Gaia collective through funding small-scale permaculture projects (we also launched [Perma.rocks](https://perma.rocks)) that bring humans in close contact with nature. We hope to remind humanity that we are a living breathing part of the ecosystem, and we are an incredible and abundant living planet. 

This connecting spirit, including our shared goal of reaching another Golden Moon, ties mathmatically-inspired in tokenomics, and rooted in the amount of real gold on Earth. 


### The Alchemist 🧙‍♂️✨🌗
GOLD was conceived by [Douglas](https://douglas.life), creator of WAX / HIVE dapp [cXc.world](https://cxc.world). cXc and GOLD are sister projects, and in addition to raising money for Permaculture, GOLD and SILVER serve to enrich the cXc economy through [rewarding participants](), and vise versa.
