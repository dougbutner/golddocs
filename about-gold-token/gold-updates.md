# ðŸŒ“ GOLD Project Updates 

##  Rewards Update 



##  NGO Update 

The legal process wasn't possible for us to secure our NGO in Peru as planned without a physical address, but we are continuing in the direction of permacultural curation organization. We really don't need an NGO to make this happen now (to raise charity funds + donate), but will move forward to a Peruvian NGO once we have land to plant ourselves. There's also an eventuality where we don't buy land in Peru, and in that case 100% of funds that end up in [gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund) will go to other permaculture projects in coordination with a public announcement.


## One Year! ðŸŽ‚ ðŸ¥³

GOLD has made it to one year old! In this time, we both remained the smallest market cap DeFi project, and also the largest % growth of market cap of any DeFi project. 

We're very pleased with the stability in the market, as well as the spreading of GOLD to more
