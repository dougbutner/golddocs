**Golden Moons** celebrate $GOLD token reaching a certain price in WAX. (NFT reward for top 100 GOLD holders after 🌕 15) We don't promise any utility, but if you take a look at all the NFT-based DeFi solutions Douglas has created, you can imagine the possibilities.  

> New Rewards: We've just added a single-token-staking GOLD to the new model below. As this makes the old system obsolete, we've indefinitely paused all of the old rewards, but you can read about them at the bottom of this page.


# The 54 Golden Moons 🧑‍🚀

Golden Moons represent a collective goal - clearing one mirrored Fibonacci sell order. Starting with Moon 16, we'll drop a NFT to the top GOLD economy participants + GOLD holders for each moon we land on. To land on the moon requires reaching above the moon price on the spot market, that is, clearing the sell order the moon represents, and thus raising that much funding.
