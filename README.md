# [#GOLDTRIBE](https://ctt.ac/5vVnB) supports Permaculture charities with metalic-math coins

## These metalic-math coins (crowned by the GOLD token) offer novelty as the first Fibonacci series-infused currency. GOLD is available on [Alcor](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/gold-goldgoldgold_wax-eosio.token) and also given to the top 100 collectors of [cXc Music NFTs](https://neftyblocks.com/c/cxcmusicnfts) by NFTs held. SILVER is a LP rewards token that can be [staked for more SILVER](https://bludac.io). $SILVER rewards GOLD, [PURPLE](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/purple-purplepurple_wax-eosio.token), and [BLUX](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/blux-bluxbluxblux_wax-eosio.token) pairs.  (Details below)

100% of the proceeds of our token sale + donations received will go to charity via the [gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund). We'll be giving 100% of proceeds to Permaculture projects, eco-charities + community projects like food forests, city gardens, etc. The idea is to change some of the bad juju from precious metal extraction to something to help Earth.

# How is this raising money for permaculture? ü§îüå≥
GOLD was released to the public very cheaply, that is, below the minimum spot trading price of 0.00000001 WAX / GOLD. While this didn't help us raise initial funds, it did create a DeFi game that anyone could play for a fraction of a WAX. Currently, the gaialovefund account has 36 billion GOLD that was donated back, and the plan now is to create a win-win-win economy using GOLD and SILVER and list this GOLD slowly on the spot market starting at the price of .00001, giving us over 200k WAX to put towards permaculture. We messed up the fundraising by selling GOLD so cheaply, but we also made an opportunity for more people to benefit in an amazing way. 

# Can SILVER be sold to raise money for permaculture too?
With SILVER, we have another ratio (the SILVER Radio) to honor, and the original plan was to offer SILVER similarly to GOLD on the market using this new ratio. With the failure of GOLD to raise more than 200 USD, we have decided to keep SILVER as a LP rewards token. We do not plan to have a sale of SILVER, nor will we ever sell any of the project's SILVER reserves on the market. By using SILVER to benefit [cXc](https://linktr/ee/cxc.world) and GOLD lp, the economy is richer, and this may make a better opportunity to help other projects as well, as [Bludac](https://r.land/blu) has. 

Listing of the final tokens (probably years away), it will be announced on our [Telegram](https://t.me/ToMoonForEarth) first, and be on the [spot market](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/gold-goldgoldgold_wax-eosio.token) as to maintain price on market. This way, we can slowly raise the final money instead of removing value from the economy using [swap](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=WAX-eosio.token&input=GOLD-goldgoldgold)

# Donate üå±

Donations to [gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund) are appreciated in any token. 

# Promise üîê

We'll let received donations and proceeds from GOLD sales sit (and stake) in [gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund) until a date where we announce the formal donation. Any expenditure of these funds will be announced to the public min 1 week ahead of time on [Telegram](https://t.me/ToMoonForEarth) and we're open for discussion, vetos, and plan to evolve the community into the Tribe model, developed by Douglas for cXc, to allow every person a say in where the funds raised from GOLD goes.
