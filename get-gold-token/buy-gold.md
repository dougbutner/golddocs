# Sell Orders ðŸ“ˆ

100% minted supply already sent to [Alcor Exchange's Spot Market](https://wax.alcor.exchange/trade/gold-goldgoldgold_wax-eosio.token) + [Swap](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=GOLD-goldgoldgold&input=WAX-eosio.token) via the [gaialovefund](https://wax.bloks.io/account/gaialovefund) account. 

This account placed the sell orders [below] except where it would be less than .00000001 WAX per gold, that GOLD was instead placed in the defi [swap](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?output=GOLD-goldgoldgold&input=WAX-eosio.token).

This lead to incredibly [cheap GOLD](https://wax.alcor.exchange/swap?input=WAX-eosio.token&output=GOLD-goldgoldgold) for early buyers, as was intended by the model, with one fortunate account picking up +30% total supply. Luckily, they dumped early to the swap, and organizer Douglas bought back 36b (15% supply) of GOLD to donate to gaialovefund. ([Tx 1](https://wax.bloks.io/transaction/c28122681068126e06ada91daec02ec1ea0ca57c3e5fcd6ff094797a35030137), [Tx 2](https://wax.bloks.io/transaction/40fe8c8fccdc8825deb823cdb2f5a3eba22957d1dbb7f4943e1cdfae6954d5cb))  

Because GOLD "started from the bottom" of the possible WAX price, there's been interesting mechanics even early in the experiment.

Sell orders were/are listed according to the Golden Ratio, as approximated by the Fibonacci series. We used mirrored Fibonacci series (below) to determine the market price of GOLD. The length of this series segment was determined by the total supply of GOLD.
